Its a bomb_escaping Game. When you click one cell , if there is a bomb then it will be blown and you lost the game. But here  an interesting part is 
that when you click any of the cell then the cell will show you some numbers, these indicates a prediction(numbers of bomb surrounded by the cell).In
order to win the game you have to survive and click on the cell wisely until the last cell is reached.

Here i use object oriented properties of python.
